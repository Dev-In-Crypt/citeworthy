/**
 * Плейбуки: повторяемые рецепты по типам работ.
 *
 * Смысл продукта — «без роста команды»: работа на десяти клиентах отличается
 * не творчеством, а объёмом. Один раз описанный рецепт переиспользуется у всех,
 * и именно это экономит те 8–12 часов в месяц, ради которых агентство платит.
 *
 * Шаги описывают процесс, а не результат: попадание в источник зависит от
 * редакции, модераторов и удачи, и обещать его в шагах было бы враньём
 * (инвариант 2). Ничего никуда не публикуется — это документ для человека
 * (инвариант 4), и текст страницы за агентство здесь не пишется (инвариант 5).

      "Fill the comparison fields the platform uses to build its own round-ups.",

      "Find the specific articles on the source that already cover this topic and note their authors and angles.",
      "Prepare one concrete, checkable fact the client can contribute: original data, a customer outcome with numbers, or a technical detail nobody else publishes.",
      "Pitch that fact to the author whose existing article it fits, not to a generic editorial address.",
      "Offer an interview slot or a data extract; keep the ask to one paragraph.",

      "Check whether the brand is named inside the passages that answer the question, or only in the layout around them.",
      "Update prices, limits and dates that have gone stale — outdated specifics are why a page gets read and then ignored.",
      "Add the missing specifics the cluster's questions ask for.",

      "Reproduce what a crawler receives: fetch the page without JavaScript and compare with what a visitor sees.",
      "Fix the specific barrier found — server errors, redirect chains, content that only exists after client-side rendering.",
      "Re-fetch and confirm the answering text is present in the raw response.",
    ],

      "Check which schema types the page should carry for its purpose: product, pricing, FAQ, organisation.",
      "Add or correct the markup so it states the same facts as the visible text.",
      "Validate the markup with the vendor's own testing tool and fix reported errors.",
    ],
    acceptance: [

    steps: [
      "Read robots.txt and the meta directives on the page for rules that block assistant crawlers specifically.",

      "Apply the change and confirm with a fetch that the page is now allowed.",
