/**
 * Fixture-ответы для демо-клиента Ledgerbrook (spend management).
 *
 * Нужны, чтобы локальные экраны показывали живую картину, а не ровный ноль:
 * набор ответов про CRM ничего не знает о Ledgerbrook, и матрица на нём
 * честно, но бесполезно состояла из нулей.
 *
 * На один вопрос заготовлено несколько ответов: сэмплы должны различаться
 * между собой, иначе доля бывает только 0% или 100% — и продукт в демо
 * противоречит собственному правилу, что один ответ не является измерением.
 *
 * Все бренды вымышлены (Ledgerbrook, Outlay, Spendhaven, Tallyard), домены —
 * в зоне .test. Демо-данные с настоящими компаниями означали бы отчёт
 * с цифрами видимости тех, кого мы никогда не измеряли.
